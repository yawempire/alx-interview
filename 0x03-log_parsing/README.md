# SOLUTION TO LOG PARSING
## Implementation Details
To implement the log parsing solution, follow these steps:

1. Read the log file: Use a file input stream to read the log file line by line.

2. Parse each log entry: Split each line into its respective fields (e.g., timestamp, log level, message) using a regular expression or string manipulation.

3. Process the log entry: Perform any necessary operations on the log entry, such as filtering, aggregating, or extracting relevant information.

4. Store or output the results: Depending on your requirements, you can store the parsed log entries in a data structure, write them to a database, or generate reports.

5. Handle errors and exceptions: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle any issues that may arise during the parsing process, such as malformed log entries or file read errors.

6. Test your solution: Create test cases to verify the correctness and efficiency of your log parsing implementation. Consider edge cases and different log formats.

7. Document your solution: Provide clear documentation on how to use your log parsing solution, including any dependencies, configuration options, and examples.

Remember to follow best practices, such as using appropriate data structures, modularizing your code, and optimizing for performance if necessary.
