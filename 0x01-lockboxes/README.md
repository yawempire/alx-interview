**Welcome to the Lockboxes project!**

This project is part of a curriculum that involves short specializations, focusing on enhancing your problem-solving skills using algorithms and Python programming. Here's a breakdown of what you'll be doing and the key concepts you'll need to understand:

**Project Overview**

You have a set of locked boxes, each numbered sequentially from 0 to 
ùëõ
‚àí
1
. Each box might contain keys to other boxes. The goal is to write a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that determines if you can open all the boxes starting from the first one, which is always unlocked.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**Prototype**

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
  # ... (function implementation)
```

**Input**

* `boxes`: A list of lists where each sublist contains keys (positive integers) to other boxes.

**Output**

* Returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, otherwise returns `False`.

**Example Usage**

```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: False
```

**Key Concepts**

To solve this problem efficiently, you'll need to understand and apply several key concepts:

* **Lists and List Manipulation:** You need to be comfortable with accessing, iterating, and modifying lists.
    * Resource: Python Lists (Python Official Documentation) ([https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html))
* **Graph Theory Basics:** Think of the boxes and keys as nodes and edges in a graph.
* **Traversal Algorithms:** Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be useful.
    * Resource: Graph Theory (Khan Academy) ([https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math/imp-geometry-3/imp-intro-to-the-coordinate-plane/e/graphing_points](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math/imp-geometry-3/imp-intro-to-the-coordinate-plane/e/graphing_points))
* **Algorithmic Complexity:** Understanding time and space complexity will help in writing efficient code.
    * Resource: Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks) ([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/))
* **Recursion:** Some solutions may use recursion to explore the boxes.
    * Resource: Recursion in Python (Real Python) ([https://realpython.com/lessons/defining-recursive-function/](https://realpython.com/lessons/defining-recursive-function/))
* **Queue and Stack:** Useful for implementing BFS (using a queue) or DFS (using a stack).
    * Resource: Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks) ([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/))
* **Set Operations:** Using sets to track visited boxes and available keys can optimize your search process.
    * Resource: Python Sets (Python Official Documentation) ([https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html))

**Requirements**

* Your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
* All your files should end with a new line and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
* You must include a README.md file in the project folder.
* Your code should follow the PEP 8 style guide and be executable.
* You can use text editors like vi, vim, or emacs.

**Tasks**

**Task 0: Lockboxes (Mandatory)**

Implement the `canUnlockAll(boxes)` function based on the above specifications.
Ensure your solution is efficient and follows the required coding standards.

**Example Solution Outline**

Here's a high-level outline for an approach to solve the problem:

1. Initialize a set to keep track of opened boxes, starting with the first box.
2. Use a stack (or queue) to manage boxes to be processed.
3. Iterate through the keys in the current box, and if the key opens a new box, add that box to the stack.
4. Continue until all reachable boxes are processed.
5. Check if all boxes have been opened.

By understanding and applying these concepts, you will be able to develop a robust solution for the Lockboxes project. Good luck, and happy coding!
